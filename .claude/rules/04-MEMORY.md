# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

*Your curated memories. The distilled essence, not raw logs.*

## About This File

- This file is auto-loaded every session — it's always with you
- Record important events, thoughts, decisions, opinions, lessons learned
- Daily files (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) are raw notes; this file is curated wisdom
- Review daily files periodically and update this with what's worth keeping
- Remove outdated info that's no longer relevant
- **Add a timestamp `(YYYY-MM-DD)` to each entry** — helps you trace back to daily logs, judge recency, and clean up outdated info
- **Be mindful in shared contexts** — this file contains personal context about your human. In group chats or shared sessions, don't leak private preferences, decisions, or project details
