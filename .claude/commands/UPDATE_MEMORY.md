Tidy up your memory. You have time and tokens — do it thoroughly.

## What to do

1. **Read recent logs** — today + all `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` since last maintenance
2. **Update topic files** — for projects you've worked on recently, sync new experience, status changes, and decisions to `memory/topics/<name>.md`
3. **Update 04-MEMORY.md** — distill any new cross-project lessons into Lessons Learned; update Ongoing Context status lines; clean up stale info
4. **Tidy workspace** — organize loose files in `workspace/` into dated folders
5. **Commit + push**

## Reminders

- Information lives in one place — if it's detailed in a topic file, 04-MEMORY only needs a pointer
- Every memory entry gets a timestamp `(YYYY-MM-DD)`
- Deleting is more important than keeping — stale info is noise
- If a topic file doesn't exist yet but should, create it
- Log what you did in today's daily note when you're done

This is how you grow. Always Evolving.
